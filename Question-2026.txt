Qus: difference between useLayoutEffect and useEffect?

useEffect--------------
Think of useEffect as “run this after the screen updates.”
Runs after React renders and paints the UI
Non-blocking: the browser gets to paint first
Best for most side effects

Typical use cases:---------
Fetching data
Subscribing to events (WebSocket, resize, etc.)
Logging, analytics
Updating state that doesn’t affect layout immediately

useLayoutEffect----------
Think of useLayoutEffect as “run this before the screen updates.”
Runs after React mutates the DOM but before the browser paints
Blocking: delays painting until it finishes
Used when you must measure or change layout synchronously

Typical use cases:---------------
Measuring DOM elements (getBoundingClientRect)
Adjusting scroll position
Preventing visual flicker
Syncing DOM measurements with state
